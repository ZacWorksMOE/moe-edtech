**Title:** 

Learning in the Making

**Synopsis:**

Today's students need to be prepared for future careers and workplaces in which their factual knowledge may not be as important as the way they can apply that knowledge. This is one of the reasons why maker education, in which students get hands-on, collaborative learning experiences and solve authentic problems, is gaining popularity in many schools. Providing a framework for maker activities helps ensure that their use is intentional and meaningful. In this keynote session, participants will get to participate in an experiential learning cycle comprising of front-loading or framing activities, experiencing hands-on with maker activities and reflecting on the maker experiences.
